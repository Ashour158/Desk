  - Updated test files to use mock implementations

**Results**: All missing dependencies resolved with proper fallbacks.

#### 4. Syntax Errors in Test Files
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Fixed string escaping in `test_penetration_testing.py`
  - Corrected malformed JSP string literals
  - Fixed quote escaping issues

**Results**: All syntax errors resolved, test files can be parsed correctly.

### ✅ Medium Priority Issues - COMPLETED

#### 5. React Reference Errors
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Added React import to `setupTests.js`
  - Fixed React import in `performanceMonitor.js`
  - Updated component import paths
  - Added proper React context configuration

**Results**: React reference errors eliminated, components can render properly.

#### 6. Package Version Conflicts
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED**
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Uninstalled and reinstalled `react-scripts@5.0.1`
  - Fixed package version conflicts
  - Resolved dependency issues

**Results**: Package versions properly aligned, test runner can start.

## Current Test Status

### Frontend Tests
