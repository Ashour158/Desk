**Impact**: Component conflicts eliminated, reducing test failures

#### 2. ✅ Install Missing Test Dependencies
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Dependencies Installed**:
- `jest-axe` - For accessibility testing
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - Enhanced Jest matchers

**Files Created**:
- `customer-portal/src/utils/testUtils.js` - Comprehensive test utilities
- `customer-portal/src/pages/ErrorPage.jsx` - Missing error page component

**Impact**: All test dependencies now available

#### 3. ✅ Resolve Remaining Test File Syntax Issues
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Issues Fixed**:
- Fixed localStorage mocking using `Object.defineProperty` in `logger.test.js`
- Fixed sessionStorage mocking for read-only properties
- Added React import to `performanceMonitor.js`
- Added React import to `bundleAnalyzer.js`
- Created missing `testUtils.js` with all test utilities

**Files Modified**:
- `customer-portal/src/__tests__/utils/logger.test.js`
- `customer-portal/src/utils/performanceMonitor.js`
- `customer-portal/src/utils/bundleAnalyzer.js`

**Impact**: All syntax errors resolved, tests can parse correctly

### Week 2: Medium-term Improvements

#### 4. ✅ Fix Django App Registry Issues
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Solutions Implemented**:
- Created `core/manage_test.py` - Proper Django test runner
- Updated `core/tests/__init__.py` - Proper Django initialization
- Added Django setup check before app imports
- Configured proper Python path and settings module

**Files Created**:
- `core/manage_test.py` - Django test management script
- `core/tests/__init__.py` - Test package initialization

**Impact**: Django app registry properly initialized before tests

#### 5. ✅ Implement Proper Test Database Setup
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Implementations**:
- Updated test settings to use in-memory SQLite database
- Added proper test database configuration
- Created `test_database_setup.py` with database utilities
- Configured test runner and database options

**Files Modified**:
- `core/config/settings/test_optimized.py` - Updated database config
- Created `core/tests/test_database_setup.py` - Database utilities

**Database Configuration**:
```python
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': ':memory:',  # In-memory for speed
        'OPTIONS': {'timeout': 20},
        'TEST': {'NAME': ':memory:'}
    }
}
```

**Impact**: Faster test execution with in-memory database

#### 6. ✅ Optimize Test Execution Performance
**Status**: COMPLETED

**Optimizations Implemented**:
- Created `run_optimized_tests.py` - Comprehensive test runner
- Configured sequential test execution to reduce memory
- Added test timeouts to prevent hanging
- Implemented separate frontend/backend/performance test runners

**Files Created**:
- `run_optimized_tests.py` - Optimized test runner script

**Performance Features**:
- Frontend tests with memory limits
- Backend tests with proper Django setup
- Performance-specific test execution
- Timeout protection (300s for main tests, 180s for performance)
- Summary reporting with timing

**Impact**: Organized test execution with performance monitoring

## Technical Improvements Summary

### Frontend Improvements
1. **Component Management**:
   - Eliminated duplicate components
   - Proper component imports
   - Centralized component definitions

2. **Test Dependencies**:
   - All missing packages installed
   - Comprehensive test utilities created
   - Proper mocking infrastructure

3. **Syntax & Configuration**:
   - Fixed all React import issues
   - Proper localStorage/sessionStorage mocking
   - Resolved all parsing errors

### Backend Improvements
1. **Django Configuration**:
   - Proper app registry initialization
   - Clean settings configuration
   - Test-specific optimizations

2. **Database Setup**:
   - In-memory database for speed
   - Proper test database configuration
   - Transaction handling utilities

3. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Dedicated test runner
   - Proper Python path setup
   - Environment configuration

## Test Execution Guide

### Running Frontend Tests
```bash
cd customer-portal
npm test -- --watchAll=false --maxWorkers=1
```

### Running Backend Tests
```bash
python core/manage_test.py core.tests.test_models
```

### Running All Tests (Optimized)
```bash
python run_optimized_tests.py
```

## Expected Outcomes

### Frontend Tests
- ✅ No memory exhaustion errors
- ✅ No React reference errors
- ✅ No component redeclaration errors
- ✅ All dependencies available
- ⚠️ Some tests may still fail due to business logic

### Backend Tests
- ✅ Django properly initialized
- ✅ Database configured correctly
- ✅ No app registry errors
- ✅ Proper test isolation
- ⚠️ Some tests may need model adjustments

## Remaining Considerations

### Minor Issues to Monitor
1. **Business Logic Tests**: Some tests may fail due to actual business logic issues rather than infrastructure
2. **Mock Configurations**: Some mocks may need fine-tuning for specific test cases
3. **Coverage Targets**: Coverage collection disabled for performance, can be re-enabled after stabilization

### Future Enhancements
1. **Parallel Test Execution**: Once stability is achieved, can enable parallel workers
2. **Coverage Reporting**: Re-enable comprehensive coverage collection
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate optimized test runner into CI/CD pipeline
4. **Test Data Factories**: Enhance test data generation utilities

## Success Metrics Achieved

### Configuration Success
- ✅ 100% of component redeclarations fixed
- ✅ 100% of missing dependencies installed
