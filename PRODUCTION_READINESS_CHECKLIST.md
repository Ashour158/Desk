## 📋 Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-deployment**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   python manage.py test
   
   # Check for migrations
   python manage.py makemigrations --check --dry-run
   
   # Collect static files
   python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
   
   # Check deployment settings
   python manage.py check --deploy
   ```

2. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Backup database first!
   
   # Run migrations
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. **Deploy Application**
   - Deploy updated code
   - Restart application servers
   - Restart Celery workers
   - Restart Celery beat scheduler
   - Restart real-time service

4. **Post-deployment Verification**
   ```bash
   # Check health endpoints
   curl https://yourdomain.com/health/
   
   # Check API endpoints
   curl https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/
   
   # Monitor logs
   tail -f logs/django.log
   tail -f logs/error.log
   
   # Check Celery workers
   celery -A config inspect active
   ```

5. **Monitoring**
   - Check application metrics
   - Monitor error rates
   - Review performance metrics
   - Check background task queues

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

If issues are detected after deployment:

1. **Quick Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Revert to previous code version
   git checkout <previous-tag>
   
   # Restart services
   systemctl restart helpdesk
   systemctl restart celery-worker
   systemctl restart celery-beat
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if needed)
   ```bash
   # Restore from backup
   # WARNING: This will lose any data created since backup
   psql -U postgres helpdesk_production < backup.sql
   ```

3. **Verify Rollback**
   - Check health endpoints
   - Test critical functionality
   - Monitor error logs

## 🔍 Common Production Issues

### High Memory Usage
- Check for memory leaks in WebSocket connections
- Review query optimization
- Monitor Celery task memory usage
- Check for large file uploads

### Slow Database Queries
- Review query plans with EXPLAIN
- Ensure indexes are being used
- Consider adding more indexes
- Use connection pooling

### High Error Rates
- Check logs for common errors
- Review recent code changes
- Check external service status
- Verify configuration

### Background Tasks Failing
- Check Celery worker status
- Review task retry settings
- Check Redis connectivity
- Review task logs
