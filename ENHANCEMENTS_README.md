## Implemented Enhancements

### ‚úÖ 1. Automatic Work Order Creation from Tickets

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Files Modified:**
- `core/apps/field_service/models.py` - Added `source_ticket`, `source` fields to WorkOrder, created `TicketToWorkOrderRule` model
- `core/apps/field_service/services.py` - NEW - WorkOrderAutomationService with 4 assignment strategies
- `core/apps/field_service/admin.py` - NEW - Admin interface for rules management

**Features:**
- Automatic work order creation when tickets are created
- Configurable business rules (TicketToWorkOrderRule)

**Usage:**
1. Create a TicketToWorkOrderRule in Django admin
2. Configure trigger conditions (categories, priorities, tags, customer types)
3. Set work order template (type, priority, duration)
4. Choose assignment logic and scheduling options
5. When a matching ticket is created, work order is automatically generated

---

## Database Migrations Required

After pulling this branch, you MUST run migrations:

```bash
# Navigate to Django project
cd /path/to/Desk/core

# Create migrations
python manage.py makemigrations field_service tickets

# Review migrations
python manage.py showmigrations

# Apply migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser if needed
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

---

## Post-Deployment Configuration

### 1. Configure Ticket-to-Work-Order Rules

Navigate to Django Admin ‚Üí Field Service ‚Üí Ticket to Work Order Rules

**Example Rule:**
- **Name:** High Priority Tickets Auto Work Order
- **Trigger Conditions:**
  - Ticket Priorities: `["high", "urgent"]`
  - Ticket Categories: `["Technical Support", "Installation"]`
- **Work Order Configuration:**
  - Work Order Type: `repair`
  - Priority: `high`
  - Duration: `2 hours`
- **Assignment:**
  - Auto Assign: `True`
  - Logic: `skill_match`
  - Required Skills: `["networking", "hardware"]`
- **Scheduling:**
  - Auto Schedule: `True`
  - Offset: `24 hours`
- **Notifications:**
  - Notify Customer: `True`
  - Notify Technician: `True`

### 2. Configure Ticket Number Sequences

Sequences are auto-created per organization on first ticket creation with defaults:
- Prefix: TK
- Format: TK-2025-00001
- Year Reset: Enabled

To customize, access Django Admin ‚Üí Tickets ‚Üí Ticket Number Sequences

## Testing Checklist

### Automatic Work Order Creation
- [ ] Create ticket with matching rule ‚Üí Work order created
- [ ] Create ticket without matching rule ‚Üí No work order created
- [ ] Multiple rules with different priorities ‚Üí Highest priority applied
- [ ] Auto-assignment with "nearest" logic ‚Üí Closest technician assigned
- [ ] Auto-assignment with "skill_match" ‚Üí Best skilled technician assigned
- [ ] Auto-scheduling ‚Üí Work order scheduled correctly
- [ ] Customer notification sent
- [ ] Technician notification sent
- [ ] Duplicate prevention ‚Üí No duplicate work orders for same ticket

### Serialized Ticket Numbering

## API Changes

### New Endpoints (if API implemented)

**Work Order Rules:**
```
GET    /api/v1/field-service/work-order-rules/
POST   /api/v1/field-service/work-order-rules/
GET    /api/v1/field-service/work-order-rules/{id}/
PUT    /api/v1/field-service/work-order-rules/{id}/
DELETE /api/v1/field-service/work-order-rules/{id}/
```

**Ticket Number Sequences:**
```
GET    /api/v1/tickets/number-sequences/
PUT    /api/v1/tickets/number-sequences/{org_id}/
```

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Indexes Added

**field_service.work_orders:**
- `source_ticket` (for quick lookup of work orders by ticket)
- `source` (for filtering by creation source)

**field_service.ticket_to_work_order_rules:**
- `organization`, `is_active`, `priority` (for rule matching queries)

**tickets.ticket_attachments:**
- `file_category` (for filtering by file type)
- `is_public` (for public/private filtering)

### Query Optimization

- Work order creation uses `select_for_update()` for atomic operations
- Ticket number generation uses database-level locking
- Technician assignment queries are optimized with proper indexes

---

## Security Enhancements

1. **File Upload Security:**
   - Virus scanning fields added (integration required)
   - File size validation support
   - MIME type validation
   - Safe/unsafe flagging

2. **Transaction Safety:**
   - All critical operations wrapped in `@transaction.atomic`
   - Proper error handling and rollback

3. **Access Control:**
   - Public/private file visibility
   - Organization-based isolation maintained

---

## Known Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Virus Scanning:** Fields added but actual scanning integration (ClamAV) not implemented
2. **Thumbnail Generation:** Fields added but automatic generation not implemented
3. **Email Integration:** Not included in this enhancement (separate task)
4. **Bulk Operations:** Not included in this enhancement (separate task)
5. **Visual Workflow Builder:** Not included in this enhancement (separate task)

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Implement virus scanning with ClamAV
2. Add thumbnail generation for images (using Pillow)
3. Create API endpoints for new features
4. Add frontend UI for rule management
5. Implement remaining enhancements (email, bulk ops, workflows)

---

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, rollback is straightforward:

```bash
# Revert to main branch
git checkout main

# Or revert specific migrations
python manage.py migrate field_service <previous_migration_name>
python manage.py migrate tickets <previous_migration_name>
```

**Note:** Rollback will preserve data but new features will be unavailable.
